(above is called a YAML header section. you can put in headers)

Start writing... introduction? information on type of dataset you will be using? 

Help-->"Markdown Quick Reference": shows you how to format the document (italics, bolding, headers, lists, links, images, inline r code, etc.)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#load packages and other options
#add r codes in these chunks
#include=FALSE --> do not include r code in final report
#echo=FALSE --> omit r code and output from report

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
